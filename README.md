# Sorting Algorithms Project

## Description

This project implements sorting algorithms in C, including the Bubble Sort algorithm. The sorting functions are designed to operate on arrays of integers and demonstrate their functionality through printing the array at each step of the sorting process.

## Files

- `0-bubble_sort.c`: Implementation of the Bubble Sort algorithm.
- `0-O`: Big O notations of the time complexity of the Bubble Sort algorithm.
- `sort.h`: Header file containing function prototypes and the `listint_t` structure.
